# Godot ports for unsupported operating systems

Here is my repository of personal porting attempts to run Godot on various older operating systems. They are accomplished with the help of AI, but I test everything the best I can on real hardware. At the moment, I have ported Godot to:

- Mac OS X Tiger/Leopard ([ppc branch](/pixaline/godot-ports/tree/ppc)) - a functioning port for OS X Leopard and up. Tiger is possible, but I don't have a suitable system to play with.
- Windows XP ([xp branch](/pixaline/godot-ports/tree/xp)) - a barebones port for Windows XP and up.

These ports were motivated by my desire to run my game, [Kemoverse Online](https://kemze.net), on retro hardware without any cheats.

Have fun! -Amina ( at «kemze» )
